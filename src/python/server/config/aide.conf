# DESCRIPTION
#
# This is configuration of the myscm-srv that specifies which files and
# directories of the system will be tracked and archived within system's image
# created with --gen-img option (see also --aide-conf option). Alongside this
# configuration file there is another configuration file, typically saved in
# /etc/myscm-srv/config.ini (see --config option) that contains remaining
# myscm-srv options, e.g. SSL certificates paths, logging configuration,
# application verbosity, output directory and more.
#
#
# CONFIGURATION SYNTAX
#
# This file uses extended AIDE syntax. All configuration options valid in AIDE
# are valid here, however not all options supported by AIDE are recommended,
# tested and guaranteed to be working as expected. E.g. `summarize_changes`
# option is forced to be set to `yes` even if this file sets it to `no`.
# `verbosity`, `grouped` and `report_base16` options are assumed to be set to
# `6`, `yes` and `no` respectively. In fact most of the options besides paths
# to tracked files and directories are assumed to be set as it is (this may
# change in future releases of the myscm-srv). If you want to learn more about
# AIDE configuration syntax see aide.conf(5) manual.
#
# Lines that begin with '#' are treated as comments except those lines that
# starts with '#!' that indicate myscm-srv extended AIDE configuration syntax.
# '#!' precedes path of the file or directory that that will be recursively
# copied to the aide.db[.X] directory while running mysm-srv with --scan
# option. This behaviour was implemented to make possible for myscm-srv to
# create patches (using `diff`) of the modified text files instead copying
# whole files. Binary files are ignored (not copied) since there is no point in
# making patch of binary file.

# The level of messages that is output. This value can be 0-255 inclusive. This
